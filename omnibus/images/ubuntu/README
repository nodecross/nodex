# How to Build and Run the Omnibus Ubuntu Environment
This guide explains how to build the Docker image and run a Bash session within the container.
When supporting build with cross, build with omnibus is not possible with the following image except in debian environment,
This will be investigated in the future.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system.

## Step 1: Build the Docker Image
Navigate to the root of the project directory and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t omnibus-ubuntu -f omnibus/images/ubuntu/Dockerfile .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the Dockerfile located at omnibus/images/ubuntu/Dockerfile. The resulting image will be tagged as omnibus-ubuntu.

## Step 2: Run the Container with a Bash Session
Once the image is built, you can start a Bash session in the container using:

```
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $(pwd):/nodex \
  -e TARGET_PLATFORM=ubuntu \
  -e TARGET_ARCH=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu \
  --privileged \
  omnibus-ubuntu bash
```

With these commands, you can easily build and interact with the Omnibus Ubuntu environment.

## Building Within Omnibus
If you need to build a package using Omnibus, refer to the README in the Omnibus directory.
